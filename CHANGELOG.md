## Release 0.7.0

New features:
- Show short-lived connections in the containers view.
  [#356](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/356)
- Details pane: add more information (docker labels, Weave IPs/hostnames,
  host/container context when ambiguous) and present it in a more intuitive way
  (include relevant information in the table titles, merge all the
  connection-related information into a single table, stop including empty fields).

## Release 0.6.0

New features:
- Probes now push data to the app, instead of the app pulling it.
  [#342](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/342)
- Allow probe and app to be started independently, via --no-app and
  --no-probe flags.
  [#345](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/345)
- Close details pane when changing topology view.
  [#297](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/297)
- Add support for --probe.foo=bar style flags, in addition to
  --probe.foo bar, which is already supported.
  [#347](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/347)
- Added X-Scope-Probe-ID header to identify probes when sending
  information to the app.
  [#351](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/351)

Bug fixes:
- Update scope script to work with master version of weave, where DNS
  has been embedded in the router.
  [#321](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/321)
- Fixed regression where process names weren't appearing for Darwin
  probes.
  [#320](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/320)
- Fixed rendering bug resulting in orphaned nodes.
  [#339](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/339)
- App now only logs to stderr, to match the probe.
  [#343](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/343)
- Use relative paths for all URLs in the UI.
  [#344](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/344)
- Removed temporary containers created by the scope script.
  [#348](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/348)

Experimental features:
- Added support for pcap based packet sniffing, to provide bandwidth
  usage information. It can be enabled via the --capture flag. When
  enabled the probe will monitor packets for a portion of the time, and
  estimate bandwidth usage. Network throughput will be affected if
  capture is enabled.
  [#317](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/pull/317)


## Release 0.5.0

  aggregate correctly. [#228](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/228)
